# Overview

## What is Kin?

Kin is a cryptocurrency with a mission to compensate everyone fairly for their contributions.
It creates a new way for big and small businesses, apps, networks, and digital services to monetize
by encouraging and facilitating value creation.
By integrating Kin with your service, be it an multiplayer video game, an online community, or any other digital service,
businesses can compensate their users for the value they’re bringing and the contributions they’re making.
